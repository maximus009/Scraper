# Scraper

Web Scraping is not an uncommon domain of programming. It forms the essential core of almost all web-based e-commerce sites,
that rely on web scraping to gather information, perform alanysis, and produce effective results.

I wanted to developed a web scraper that mines all of the information regarding tech-specs of a mobile phone and save it in a personal database and use it later for some further analytics. That, I leave up to the brain's creativity.

On searching extensively, I did not find many mobile-phone-databases, and took to scraping it myslef. Hope this set of programs
serve your purpose and that I have simplified your search space! 

On the technical hindight, all you need is an environment for Python development, BeautifulSoup, and Py-exelerator packages (I used 'xlwt' to write to Excel or any spreadsheet for that matter.)


Cheers!
